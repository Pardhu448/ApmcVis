* Effect of MSP on market prices of agriculture produce - To understand the effect of MSP mechanism on the actual market prices of agriculture produce.   

* Implementation efficiency of MSP/Procurement - This involves analysing variations in implementation of MSP/procurement across different mandis.  

## Data 

Data available/used for the purposes of our analysis:

* MSP declared for kharif and rabi crops over three years(2014-2016)
* Market prices of different crops averaged over a month for mandis in maharashtra for three years
* Volume of quantity arriving in a mandi averaged over a month

## Scope/Limitations of study

Our focus in this study is the effect of MSP and procurement on market price in a given Mandi. Some of the important aspects we will ignoring are given below: 

* Otherside of MSP mechanism - to control the inflation of food prices for consumers
* Other influencers of market prices - international market prices, APMC specific rules etc  
* Real benefits to farmers - as most farmers sell their produce to middle men at their farms only
* Awareness of MSP - awareness of MSP and thus its effect on farmers sowing pattern is only around 30 percent in most of the states
